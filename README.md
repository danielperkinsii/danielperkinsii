### Daniel Perkins- @danielperkinsii 
Hey, I'm Daniel! I'm a freelance web developer based in the midwest, interested in collaborating on new projects while building a bigger client base. I previously worked in construction, but wanted more room for creativity so I sought software as my new craft. I love learning, networking, and building.
