### Daniel Perkins- @danielperkinsii 
Hey, I'm Daniel! I'm a freelance web developer based in the midwest interested in collaborating on new projects while building a bigger client base
. I previously worked in construction, but wanted more room for creativity so I sought software as my new craft. I love learning, networking, and building. Connect with me and let's work together! 🤠


## My Interests
- 😺 My cat.
- 🎵 Pretty much all music.
- 👨‍💻 Learning technologies.
- 📚 Reading mystery, business, history, finance, design, and biographies.
- 🎙 Podcasts about tech, science, news, Kentucky sports, philosophy, and creativity.
- 🏃💨 Running between 5k and 50k.
- 🏔 New challenges.

## How I work 
I'm at my best when I'm [time blocking](https://todoist.com/productivity-methods/time-blocking) my tasks. I try to minimize meetings for the sake of meeting. My philosophy is that if it can be said in a meeting, it can probably be said in an email, and if it can be said in an email, it can probably be said in a text. 

*However, I love networking and will carve out time to build new relationships.*
